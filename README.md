# Real-Time-Face-Detection-App
Real-Time Face Detection is a simple Python application that performs real-time face detection using OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier. The application captures video from the webcam and detects faces in the video stream. It draws rectangles around the detected faces in real-time.
# Requirements
1. Python 3.x

2. OpenCV library (install using pip install opencv-python)
# Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook.

3. Then navigate to the cloned repository.
# How to Use
1. Run the Python script to start the real-time face detection application.

2. The application will access your webcam and display the video stream with rectangles around detected faces.

3. Press 'q' to stop the application and close the window.
