# Real-Time-Face-Detection-App
Real-Time Face Detection is a simple Python application that performs real-time face detection using OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier. The application captures video from the webcam and detects faces in the video stream. It draws rectangles around the detected faces in real-time.
